On-Demand Instance costs
On-Demand DB instances let you pay for your database by the hour with no long-term commitments or upfront fees. This frees you from the cost and complexity of planning and purchasing database capacity ahead of your needs. On-Demand DB instances are ideal for development, test, and other short-lived workloads.
Pricing is per DB instance-hour consumed from the time a DB instance is launched until it is deleted. Partial DB instance-hours are billed in one-second increments with a 10-minute minimum charge following a billable status change such as creating, starting, or modifying the DB instance class.
Note: On-Demand Instances are available for both Standard Edition 2 (SE2) and Enterprise Edition (EE). Charges do not vary by edition for Amazon RDS Custom for Oracle Bring Your Own Media (BYOM) model. The BYOM pricing table shows price per hour for Single-AZ and Multi-AZ by Region.
